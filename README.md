A simple NodeJS playground containing a helpful combination of code, comments, and notes that I made
in my attempt to master NodeJS, ExpressJS, and any other JS framework that comes my way


Created Saturday January 23, 1:26 AM


<h2> express_demo </h2>

This folder contains a basic express app that demonstrates middleware, the Router object, view engines, and serving static content
More will be added as I plug in more express-related modules such as body-parser, cookie-session, etc


<h2> httpwebserver </h2>

This folder contains a very crude, simple web server in NodeJS that doesn't even use Express
Made it to play around with making a nodeJS server without the use of a library like express
honestly wasn't too helpful


<h2> events.js </h2>

Not an app, but more a single file with a lot of comments that helped me make sense of the EventEmitter object in NodeJS
Contains explanation of how event-driven programming works in Node


<h2> restful_express_api </h2>

The result of following a tutorial from scotch.io on creating an API using Express


<h2> modules_demo </h2>

An example and large explanation on how the module system works in NodeJS. Not super in depth, but enough to understand how require statements work
and how to use module.exports. See <b>greetings.js</b> for the large comment section, see main.js for how the sample modules get imported and used

<h2> block_read.js and nonblock_read.js </h2>

Two different files that read in a sample file (input.txt) and demonstrate the difference between synchrnous and asychrnous functions



<h2> passportjs </h2>

The result of following a tutorial from scotch.io on creating an authenticated app using PassportJS

<h2> Mocha </h2>
Did a quick easy tutorial for Mocha. Not a lot to learn from this section because it was a short tutorial and I didn't comment a lot, but there are some (limited) notes on describe(), it(), and hooks at the top of the test/server.js. I followed this tutorial <a>https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-js-and-mocha</a>
