A simple NodeJS playground containing a helpful combination of code, comments, and nodes that I made
in my attempt to master NodeJS, ExpressJS, and any other JS framework that comes my way


Created Saturday January 23, 1:26 AM


<b> express_demo </b>

This folder contains a basic express app that demonstrates middleware, the Router object, view engines, and serving static content
More will be added as I plug in more express-related modules such as body-parser, cookie-session, etc


<b> httpwebserver </b>

This folder contains a very crude, simple web server in NodeJS that doesn't even use Express
Made it to play around with making a nodeJS server without the use of a library like express
honestly wasn't too helpful


<b> events.js </b>

Not an app, but more a single file with a lot of comments that helped me make sense of the EventEmitter object in NodeJS
Contains explanation of how event-driven programming works in Node


<b> block_read.js and nonblock_read.js </b>

Two different files that read in a sample file (input.txt) and demonstrate the difference between synchrnous and asychrnous functions
